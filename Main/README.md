### Regular Expression Pattern Explanation:

The regular expression pattern used for credit card number validation is:

```regex
/^4[0-9]{12}(?:[0-9]{3})?$/
```

- `^`: Asserts the start of the string.
- `4`: Matches the digit 4, indicating that the credit card number must start with the digit 4.
- `[0-9]{12}`: Matches exactly 12 digits (0-9) after the initial 4. This ensures that there are 12 more digits following the initial 4.
- `(?:[0-9]{3})?`: Optionally matches 3 additional digits (0-9) using a non-capturing group `(?:)` followed by `?`. This allows for an additional 3 digits to be present or absent.
- `$`: Asserts the end of the string.

### Explanation:

This regular expression pattern is designed to validate credit card numbers that follow the format of Visa cards. Here's a breakdown:

- The pattern starts with `^` to ensure that the matching starts at the beginning of the string.
- The digit `4` indicates that all valid credit card numbers must start with the digit 4, as is the case with Visa cards.
- `[0-9]{12}` specifies that there must be exactly 12 digits (0-9) following the initial 4, ensuring a total length of 13 digits.
- `(?:[0-9]{3})?` allows for an additional 3 digits (0-9) to be present optionally. This accommodates for Visa card numbers that might have a total length of 16 digits.
- `$` ensures that the matching ends at the end of the string, ensuring the entire string conforms to the specified pattern.

Overall, this regular expression pattern effectively validates credit card numbers that adhere to the format of Visa cards.
